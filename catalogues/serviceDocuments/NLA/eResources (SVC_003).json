The Library’s role, as defined by the National Library Act 1960, is to ensure that documentary resources of national significance relating to Australia and the Australian people, as well as significant non-Australian library materials, are collected, preserved and made accessible either through the Library or through collaborative arrangements with other libraries and information providers. By offering a strong national focus in all that we do and cooperating with others who share our goals, we support learning and creative and intellectual endeavour and contribute to the vitality of Australian culture and heritage.",
