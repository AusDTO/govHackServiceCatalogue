    "description": "The Early Release of Superannuation Benefits (ERSB) programme administers the very limited circumstances where benefits may be released on specified compassionate grounds. These are: medical/dental treatment for the person or a dependant; medical/dental transport for the person or a dependant; to prevent a person's home from being sold by the mortgagee (lender); modifications to a person's home or vehicle to accommodate the persons needs or the needs of their dependant, in the case of severe disability; palliative care for a terminal illness, for the person or a dependant; expenses associated with a dependant's death, funeral or burial.  In these cases, a release may only be approved where the person lacks the financial capacity to meet the relevant expense connected with the ground for release. ",
