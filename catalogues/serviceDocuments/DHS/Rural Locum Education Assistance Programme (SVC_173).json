This is a one off incentive which gives participants financial assistance up to a total of $6,000 to undertake emergency medicine training.\nThe department maintains a register of eligible GPs and makes payments to GPs when theyï¿½ve completed their first 10 working days of the locum commitment. Human Services also tracks the two year period for participants to undertake their locum commitment.",
