A customer may only receive a DRA or Ex Gratia - Income Support Allowance for the same event, not both. The policy covering these payments is owned and developed by the Attorney-General's Department. Because every emergency is different and the impact on individuals can vary, Ex Gratia - Income Support Allowance policy is tailored to meet those needs. ",
