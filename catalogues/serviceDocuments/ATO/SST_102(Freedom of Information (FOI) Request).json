      "desc": "The Education component covers all services in which the Tax Office proactively provides the community about tax and superannuation obligations. Generally these services have an education focus with the aim to influence voluntary compliance - making it easier to comply through self-registration activities. This could include items that are sent out to the general community such as media releases, brochures issued through schools, TV or radio advertisements, or speaker events. Additionally this also includes educational communication campaigns targeted at specific groups - for example, we may identify that everyone receiving FTB part A may be eligible for Education Tax Refund, so a mail out could be sent to those people specifically. The Support component covers all advice the Tax Office provides in response to requests from the community seeking advice to help them meet their tax and super obligations or request refunds. Advice could either be general in nature (eg. Can you tell me how CGT works?) or could be related specifically to the customer's personal circumstances (eg. Can you tell me how I can calculate my rental deductions?). Providing efficient accurate advice helps to fulfil our responsibilities to the community as per the Tax Payer's Charter and is key in promoting voluntary compliance through assisting those who are trying to meet their obligations."
